# Installation and launche

To install all library and .exe that you need to launch john, you can execute installation.bat in the install folder. That will install all package you need.

But somtimes the installation of dlib issues to problem, so you can't install face recognition. ( that is my case). If you can't install dlib please :

1) Install anaconda : https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2) Open anaconda prompt and create new environment <conda create --name YOURNAME python=PYTHON_VERSION> and activate it < conda activate YOURNAME>
3) Verify that you have install cmake and visual studio c++ dev
3) Install library, to do that cd the anaconda command prompt to install folder < cd INSTALL_FOLDER > and type < pip install -r requirements.txt >
